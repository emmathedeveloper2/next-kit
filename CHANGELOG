# CHANGELOG

## 2025-05-29

### Initializes Next.js auth starter kit

Sets up a Next.js starter project with authentication, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL.

- Implements email/password authentication with session management
- Integrates Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS styling
- Configures Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions
- Adds server actions for handling authentication logic
- Sets up basic UI components and layouts for authentication flows
- Includes a new custom theme with global styles

### Implements code-based authentication

Refactors authentication to use a short-lived code
sent to the user's email instead of a long-lived token.

This change improves security by reducing the window of
opportunity for unauthorized access.
